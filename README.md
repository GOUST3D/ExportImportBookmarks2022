Tools for importing and exporting .json data from the Bookmark Manager featured in Maya 2022



#  | Installation

Create shelf buttons:   RMB > Edit > Add Button > Copy Paste Code > Set to "Python"

I like to set the in / out icons to: outArrow, inArrow

and name them "impBM" / "expBM"


#  | Usage

Export: Saves a "BookmarkExport.json" into the same folder as the scene file

Import: Loads "BookmarkExport.json" into the same scene file as the folder

Update: Sometimes you have to hit import twice to make sure it replaces the values (if you have a field already selected)

#  Enjoy!
